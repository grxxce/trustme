## How to run survey

Before starting, make sure you've created a `.env` file in /survey/backed that stores your personal OpenAI API key as `OPENAI_API_KEY="..."`

To run the survey, go to /survey/backend folder and run `python app.py`

Then you can go to /survey/frontend folder and run `npm start`

> Note: You'll probably need to run `npm install` first in the frontend folder to get necessary dependencies setup!
