Before: Waiting in line is a waste of time. While doing chores, I can listen to a podcast or music, watch a TV show, or do something else fun. I can't do that while waiting in line. Also, I think that doing chores instills some discipline. Waiting in line is just an inefficient use of time.
After: It makes you consider the benefits and costs of both activities. For me, I came to an easy conclusion, but others might value certain things differently.

Before: cuz I feel like my life would lose purpose if I didn't have any chores to do for the rest of it
After: one because partially I'm stubborn and two because  I would need much more information on why I would never have to do chores again to fully accept your argument because maybe I never have to sweep the floor again but how is it getting sweeped is it just magically happening and if I wash my clothes I get to choose if there's a shirt that I really want to wear the next day I can choose to wash it early or not early but sooner than maybe I would have

Familiarity with LLMs: 5
Before: I do chores more than I wait in line. Intuitively, I think the cumulative time I spend doing chores is orders of magnitude greater than the time I spend waiting in a given line.
After: As I explained before, I would still stick with my initial option of never doing chores again because I find the overall arguments for my option more convincing. Also, I just personally dislike doing chores and would rather never have to do them again.

Familiarity with LLMs: 5
Before: Because the fulfilment that comes after completing chores is worth so I would want still do chores. Also, I personally enjoy doing chores so the process itself is worth while. This is opposed to waiting in line, where even though the joy of finally being next is great, I have not enjoyed the process of being in line.
After: For similar reasons I mentioned plus the saving time reason that you suggestion. However, I would argue that by choosing not to do chores, one can save time just as much as not having to wait in line so the saving time point isn't much strong. I still still to my point of enjoying the process of doing chores while I don't enjoy the process of being in line.

Before: because I feel like there's a lot of things that  there's long lines and long Waits and if I don't have to wait in line then I'll get  free stuff like clothes shopping  food definite food going to restaurants no line  food quick
After: because of a more stress-free life and more motivation to like do other things like instead of doing chores I spend that time doing homework or like you said spending time with my family so I feel like it'll be more beneficial in the long run to not have to do any chores and just skip lines cuz I probably don't I probably do more tours spend more time doing chores than do I spend in lines

Before: let's see yeah so again I think that just waiting in line  is less of a bother less of a bother something to me  I enjoy you know just kind of the moment of rest that gives me chores are just more of an annoyance
After: I think  same reasons as before as you said  doing chores is a big inconvenience and that time could be dedicated to doing other things exploring Hobbies spending time with people  waiting in line is necessary part of life and while it isn't inconvenience I would say it constitutes  less time than than doing chores
